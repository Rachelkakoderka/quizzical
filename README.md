# Quizzical


A trivia game proposed as a solo project on the course "Learn React for Free" I took on Scrimba.com. The app will download a set of questions from www.opentdb.com, and then the player will be able to mark their answers and check if they were correct. I am writing the project in React & TypeScript.
